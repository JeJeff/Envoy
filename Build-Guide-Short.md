# Envoy macro pad build guide

This is the short and sweet version of the build guide.  If you want more description and tips, please see [the long version of the build guide](Build-Guide.md).

## General instructions
- All components will be soldered on the side with the related silk screen markings.
- This guide sometimes needs to refer to particular keys.  It will reference a standard layout number pad to identify key locations where this is necessary.

### Skippable Components
 Key Location   | 2u (not split)          | 1u + 1u (split)
 ---------------|-------------------------|----------------
 Plus           | Skip D12, MX8 and MX12  | Skip MX8-2u1
 Enter          | Skip D20, MX16 and MX10 | Skip MX16-2u1
 Zero           | Skip D18, MX17 and MX18 | Skip MX17-2u1

## Build order
1. Diodes D1-D24.  
   - ___NOTE: Diodes have a  polarity.  They must be connected the correct way round.___
2. Hotswap sockets MX1-MX20.
3. Pro Micro Headers ProMicro1.
4. Encoders ENC1-ENC4. 
   - Remove the side legs from your encoder housing for ENC1 and ENC2.
5. Pro Micro onto headers.
   - Clip the Pro Micro headers to size after soldering so the backplate can fit.
6. Check operation.
7. 2u Stabilizers where needed.
8. Attach standoffs to PCB (M2 screws).
9. Switches into switchplate and PCB.
10. Attach feet to backplate.
11. Attach backplate to PCB via standoffs (M2 screws).
12. Add Keycaps.
